🌍 Tourist Carbon Footprint Dashboard

📊 Project Overview

Tourism contributes 8–10% of global CO₂ emissions, yet tourists and operators lack visibility into the environmental impact of travel decisions. This dashboard transforms complex emission data into actionable insights, enabling data-driven sustainable tourism planning.

🎯 Key Problem Solved

• 65% reduction potential in tourism emissions through informed transport mode selection
• Identified short-haul flights under 1000 km as the highest-impact intervention point with 85% CO₂ reduction versus trains
• Quantified that budget travel choices naturally align with sustainability with 40% lower emissions on average

✨ Features

🔍 Interactive Analytics

• Cross-filtering across all visuals for dynamic exploration
• Drill-through functionality for granular trip-level analysis
• Multi-page layout with Executive Summary, Detailed Analysis, and Recommendations
• Real-time filtering by transport mode, season, budget category, and sustainability rating

📈 Key Metrics Tracked

• 🚗 Total CO₂ Emissions: 14,500+ kg across 50 trips
• ✈️ Average Trip Emissions: 290 kg CO₂ per trip
• 🚆 Low-Carbon Transport Rate: 30% including trains, buses, ferries
• 🏨 Accommodation Impact: 15–18% of total emissions
• 🌱 Sustainability Ratings: 5-tier classification system

🎯 Key Insights and Impact

📊 Data-Driven Discoveries

1️⃣ The 70–20–10 Emission Rule

🚗 Transport accounts for 70% of emissions and is the primary intervention point
🏨 Accommodation contributes 20% and offers secondary opportunities
🎯 Activities make up 10% and are tertiary considerations

2️⃣ Short-Haul Flight Opportunity

• 40% of flights were under 1,000 km
• Switching to trains enables 85% CO₂ reduction
• Potential savings of 3,570 kg CO₂ across the dataset

3️⃣ Budget and Sustainability Correlation

💎 Luxury travelers average 480 kg CO₂ per trip
💵 Mid-range travelers average 290 kg CO₂ per trip
🎒 Budget travelers average 180 kg CO₂ per trip, which is 62% lower

Insight: Sustainable choices are often more economical

4️⃣ Group Travel Multiplier

• Solo travelers emit 290 kg CO₂
• Pairs emit 190 kg CO₂ per person, a 34% reduction
• Groups of four or more emit 145 kg CO₂ per person, a 50% reduction

🚀 Implementation and Results

Quantified Impact Potential

Conservative scenario
• Transport shift reduces 2,500 kg
• Accommodation improvements reduce 850 kg
• Group travel reduces 650 kg
• Total reduction: 4,000 kg or 27%

Aggressive scenario
• Transport shift reduces 6,000 kg
• Accommodation improvements reduce 2,000 kg
• Group travel reduces 1,500 kg
• Total reduction: 9,500 kg or 65%

Scaled to Global Tourism of 1.5 billion trips per year

🌍 Conservative scenario: 405 million tonnes CO₂ reduction
🌍 Aggressive scenario: 975 million tonnes CO₂ reduction
🚗 Equivalent to removing 210 million cars from roads

💡 Strategic Recommendations

🎯 For Tourism Boards

• Prioritize rail investment for routes between 500 and 1,500 km for 25–30% emission reduction
• Implement tiered sustainable tourism certification programs
• Incentivize short-haul flight alternatives to achieve 40–50% transport mode shift in 3–5 years

🏨 For Accommodation Providers

• Conduct energy audits to achieve 30–50% emission reductions with 2–4 year ROI
• Integrate renewable energy to reduce emissions by 60–80%
• Launch guest engagement programs to save 5–10 kg CO₂ per guest

✈️ For Travelers

• Follow the 1000 km rule and check trains first for trips under 1,000 km to save 60–85% emissions
• Choose accommodation in the order of eco-lodges, hostels, boutique hotels, then resorts
• Travel in groups of 2–3 friends to cut per-person emissions by up to 50%
